# Housing and Inflation in the US
### December 2022

## Serving as the Project Manager for this analysis in Python, my team and I dived into the analysis of housing prices and inflation through the years of 2004-2014 to gain a better understanding of what occured in the economy during this decade and determine how to prepare for a similar economic event in the future.

## By webscraping from the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) website, we pulled two datasets: a housing dataset with 89 records and 7 variables, and an inflation dataset with 1,717 records and 7 variables. 
## To prepare the data for analysis, we had to clean and merge. After cleaning the dataset and removing extraneous variables that would not be involved in analysis, the datasets were reduced to 3 variables each, being time, location and housing/inflation value. To merge the dataset, we worked on the time variable as the records were collected by quarter & year. 

## To begin analysis, we began with identifying the mean and standard deviation for the housing value and inflation value. Scatter plots were then created to depict the up and down, volatile, nature of the housing value over the years, compared to the rather scattered inflation values. Lastly, we created a correlation matrix to visualize the correlation between the housing value and inflation between 2004-2014, in the midst of the housing crisis. 

## At the conclusion of our analysis, we found:
### The correlation between Housing Value and Inflation is 0.316, meaning it is not a strong relationship. Inflation was at all time high in 2008, and Housing prices were at an all-time high in 2007. 
### Although inflation peaked later down in the timeline of 2004 - 2014, both variables experienced high numbers and caused problems for the citizens of United States as the economy encountered turbulence.
### With continuous increase of housing values in 2007, there was an clear indication of potential rises in inflation, and that needed to be highlighted to make future analysis so there could be potential reflections to prevent the fall of economy again in America. 

## While there appears to be no correlation relationship, we discovered that there is a causation relationship between housing value and inflation value in the United States economy.
